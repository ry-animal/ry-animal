# hello, welcome to my github 🌊
- 🌴 stay awhile and take a peek at what i've been working on
- 💻 a lot of typescript-based projects, but I'm trying to write more golang and keep rust on the wings -- trying to avoid java and microsoft jave
- ☁️ prefer cloud native and serverless platforms and functions
- ⛓️ web3 development too
- 🤝 reach out if looking to collaborate
- 🍻 cheers!
